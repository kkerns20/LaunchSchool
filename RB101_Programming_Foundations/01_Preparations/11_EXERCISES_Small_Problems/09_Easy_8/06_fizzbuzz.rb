Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Example:

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

=end

def fizzbuzz(int_1, int_2)
  int_1.upto(int_2) do |x|
    case
    when x % 15 ==0
      puts 'FizzBuzz'
    when x % 5 == 0
      puts 'Buzz'
    when x % 3 == 0
      puts 'Fizz'
    else
      puts x
    end
  end
end

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz
