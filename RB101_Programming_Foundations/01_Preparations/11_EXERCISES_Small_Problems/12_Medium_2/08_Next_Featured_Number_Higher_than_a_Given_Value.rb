A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, and whose digits occur exactly once each. So, for example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a method that takes a single integer as an argument, and returns the next featured number that is greater than the argument. Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.

Examples:

featured(12) == 21
featured(20) == 21
featured(21) == 35
featured(997) == 1029
featured(1029) == 1043
featured(999_999) == 1_023_547
featured(999_999_987) == 1_023_456_987

featured(9_999_999_999) # -> There is no possible number that fulfills those requirements

def unique_digits?(int)
  digits = Hash.new(0)

  int.to_s.chars.each { |char| digits[char] += 1 }
  digits.values.max == 1
end

def featured(int)
  if int % 7 == 0
    number = int + 7
  else
    number = (int / 7.0).ceil * 7
  end

  loop do
    return number if number.odd? && unique_digits?(number)
    number += 7
    break if number > 9_999_999_999
  end
