=begin

The Array#bsearch method is used to search ordered Arrays more quickly than #find and #select can. Assume you have the following code:
=end

a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]

=begin
How would you search this Array to find the first element whose value exceeds 8?

=end

puts a.bsearch { |x| x > 8}
