Write a method named include? that takes an Array and a search value as arguments. This method should return true if the search value is in the array, false if it is not. You may not use the Array#include? method in your solution.

include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
include?([], 3) == false
include?([nil], nil) == true
include?([], nil) == false

=end

def include?(array, object)
  array.count(object) > 0
end

puts include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
puts include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
puts include?([], 3) == false
puts include?([nil], nil) == true
puts include?([], nil) == false
