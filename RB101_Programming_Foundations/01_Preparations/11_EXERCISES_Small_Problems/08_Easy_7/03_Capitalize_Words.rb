=begin

Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

Examples

word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

=end

def word_cap(str)
  output = []
  str.split.each do |x|
    output << x.capitalize
  end
  output.join(' ')
end

puts word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
puts word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
puts word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'
