=begin

Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments, and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments, with the elements taken in alternation.

You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty, and that they have the same number of elements.

Example:

interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']

=end

def interleave(arr_1, arr_2)
  output = []
  arr_1.size.times do
    output << arr_1.shift
    output << arr_2.shift
  end
  output
end

puts interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']
