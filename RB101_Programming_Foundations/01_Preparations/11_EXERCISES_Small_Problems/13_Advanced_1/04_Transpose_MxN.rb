In the previous exercise, you wrote a method to transpose a 3 x 3 matrix as represented by a ruby Array of Arrays.

Matrix transposes aren't limited to 3 x 3 matrices, or even square matrices. Any matrix can be transposed by simply switching columns with rows.

Modify your transpose method from the previous exercise so it works with any matrix with at least 1 row and 1 column.

Examples:

transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) == [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]) ==
  [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
transpose([[1]]) == [[1]]

def transpose(arr_of_arrs)
  output = []
  init_rows = arr_of_arrs.size
  init_cols = arr_of_arrs[0].size

  init_cols.times do |col_id|
    new_row = []
    init_rows.times { |row_id| new_row << arr_of_arrs[row_id][col_id] }
    output << new_row
  end

  output
end

puts transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
puts transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) == [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
puts transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]) ==
  [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
puts transpose([[1]]) == [[1]]
