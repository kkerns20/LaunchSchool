A triangle is classified as follows:

right One angle of the triangle is a right angle (90 degrees)
acute All 3 angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees
obtuse One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
To be a valid triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180 degrees, and all angles must be greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :right, :acute, :obtuse, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is a right, acute, obtuse, or invalid triangle.

You may assume integer valued angles so you don't have to worry about floating point errors. You may also assume that the arguments are specified in degrees.

Examples:

triangle(60, 70, 50) == :acute
triangle(30, 90, 60) == :right
triangle(120, 50, 10) == :obtuse
triangle(0, 90, 90) == :invalid
triangle(50, 50, 50) == :invalid

def triangle(int_1, int_2, int_3)
  angles = [int_1, int_2, int_3]

  case
  when angles.sum != 180, angles.min <= 0
    :invalid
  when angles.max < 90
    :acute
  when angles.max > 90
    :obtuse
  else
    :right
  end
end

puts triangle(60, 70, 50) == :acute
puts triangle(30, 90, 60) == :right
puts triangle(120, 50, 10) == :obtuse
puts triangle(0, 90, 90) == :invalid
puts triangle(50, 50, 50) == :invalid
