    "I am returning a string for #{name}!"
end

puts greeting("Justin")

    x * y
end

=begin
4 - What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
    words = words + "!!!!"
    return
    puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

# This will return nil, since nothing follows the return keyword.

=end

#5 - Edit the method definition in exercise 4 so that it does print words on the screen. What does it return now?

def scream_2(words)
    words = words + "!!!!"
    puts words
    return words
end

scream_2("Yippeee")

#It returns the string valued "Yippeee!!!!"
