In an earlier exercise, you wrote a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. Our solution looked like this:

number_of_lines = nil
loop do
  puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:'
  number_of_lines = gets.to_i
  break if number_of_lines >= 3
  puts ">> That's not enough lines."
end

while number_of_lines > 0
  puts 'Launch School is the best!'
  number_of_lines -= 1
end

Modify this program so it repeats itself after each input/print iteration, asking for a new number each time through. The program should keep running until the user enters q or Q.

Examples:

$ ruby lsprint2.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
5
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
2
>> That's not enough lines.
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
3
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
q

=end

number_of_lines = nil
loop do
    puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):'
    reply = gets.downcase
    if reply = 'q'
        break
    else
        number_of_lines = reply.to_i
    end

    if number_of_lines >= 3
        while number_of_lines > 0
            puts 'Launch School is the best!'
            number_of_lines -= 1
        end
    else
        puts ">> That's not enough lines."
    end
end
