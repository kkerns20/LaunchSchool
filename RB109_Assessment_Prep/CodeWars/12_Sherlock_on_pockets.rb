# Sherlock has to find suspects on his latest case. He will use your method, dear Watson. Suspect in this case is a person which has something not allowed
# in his/her pockets.

#   Allowed items are defined by array of numbers.
  
#   Pockets contents are defined by map entries where key is a person and value is one or few things represented by an array of numbers
# (can be nil or empty array if empty), example:
  
#   pockets = { 
#     bob: [1],
#     tom: [2, 5],
#     jane: [7]
#   } 
#   Write method which helps Sherlock to find suspects. If no suspect is found or there are no pockets (pockets == nil), the method should return nil.
  
#   find_suspects(pockets, [1, 2]) # => [:tom, :jane]
#   find_suspects(pockets, [1, 7, 5, 2]) # => nil
#   find_suspects(pockets, []) # => [:bob, :tom, :jane]
#   find_suspects(pockets, [7]) # => [:bob, :tom]

pockets = { bob: [1],
            tom: [2, 5],
            jane: [7]
          }

def find_suspects(hsh, arr)

  # from pockets, reject
    # values array - input array == []

  # return only the keys from the  post reject hash

  suspects = hsh.reject do |_, value|
    value - arr == []
  end

  return suspects.keys if suspects.size >= 1

  nil
