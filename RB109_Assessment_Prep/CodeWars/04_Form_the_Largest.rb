# Task
# Given a number , Return _The Maximum number _ could be formed from the digits of the number given .

# Notes
# Only Natural numbers passed to the function , numbers Contain digits [0:9] inclusive !alt !alt

# Digit Duplications could occur , So also consider it when forming the Largest !alt

# Input >> Output Examples:
# maxNumber (213) ==> return (321)
# Explanation:
# As 321 is _The Maximum number _ could be formed from the digits of the number *213*** .

# maxNumber (7389) ==> return (9873)
