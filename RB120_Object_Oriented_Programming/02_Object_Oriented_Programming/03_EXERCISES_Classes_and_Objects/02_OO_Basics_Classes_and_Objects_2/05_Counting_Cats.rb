=begin

Using the following code, create a class named Cat that tracks the number of times a new Cat object is instantiated. The total number of Cat instances should be printed when ::total is invoked.

kitty1 = Cat.new
kitty2 = Cat.new

Cat.total
Expected output:

2

class Cat
  @@count = 0

  def initialize
    @@count += 1
  end

  def self.total
    @@count
  end
end

kitty1 = Cat.new
kitty2 = Cat.new

puts Cat.total
