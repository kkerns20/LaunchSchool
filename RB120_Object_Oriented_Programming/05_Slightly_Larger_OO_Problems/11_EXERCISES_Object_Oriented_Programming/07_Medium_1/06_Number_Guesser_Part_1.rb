Create an object-oriented number guessing class for numbers in the range 1 to 100, with a limit of 7 guesses per game. The game should play like this:

game = GuessingGame.new
game.play

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 104
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100: 50
Your guess is too low.

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 75
Your guess is too low.

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 85
Your guess is too high.

You have 4 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 0
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100: 80

You have 3 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 81
That's the number!

You won!

game.play

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 50

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 25
Your guess is too low.

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 37

You have no more guesses. You lost!
Note that a game object should start a new game with a new number to guess with each call to #play.
