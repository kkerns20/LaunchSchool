In our Ruby course content on blocks, we learn about "symbol to proc" and how it works. To review briefly, consider this code:

Copy Code
comparator = proc { |a, b| b <=> a }
and the Array#sort method, which expects a block argument to express how the Array will be sorted. If we want to use comparator to sort the Array, we have a problem: it is a proc, not a block. The following code:

Copy Code
array.sort(comparator)
fails with an ArgumentError. To get around this, we can use the proc to block operator & to convert comparator to a block:

Copy Code
array.sort(&comparator)
This now works as expected, and we sort the Array in reverse order.

When applied to an argument object for a method, a lone & causes ruby to try to convert that object to a block. If that object is a proc, the conversion happens automatically, just as shown above. If the object is not a proc, then & attempts to call the #to_proc method on the object first. Used with symbols, e.g., &:to_s, Ruby creates a proc that calls the #to_s method on a passed object, and then converts that proc to a block. This is the "symbol to proc" operation (though perhaps it should be called "symbol to block").

Note that &, when applied to an argument object is not the same as an & applied to a method parameter, as in this code:

Copy Code
def foo(&block)
  block.call
end
While & applied to an argument object causes the object to be converted to a block, & applied to a method parameter causes the associated object to be converted to a proc. In essence, the two uses of & are opposites.

Did you know that you can perform a similar trick with methods? You can apply the & operator to an object that contains a Method; in doing so, Ruby calls Method#to_proc.

Using this information, together with the course page linked above, fill in the missing part of the following code so we can convert an array of integers to base 8 (octal numbers). Use the comments for help in determining where to make your modifications, and make sure to review the "Approach/Algorithm" section for this exercise; it should prove useful.

Copy Code
def convert_to_base_8(n)
  n.method_name.method_name # replace these two method calls
end

# The correct type of argument must be used below
base8_proc = method(argument).to_proc

# We'll need a Proc object to make this code work. Replace `a_proc`
# with the correct object
[8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 33].map(&a_proc)
The expected return value of map on this number array should be:

Copy Code
[10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]
You don't need a deep understanding of octal numbers -- base 8 -- for this problem. It's enough to know that octal numbers use the digits 0-7 only, much as decimal numbers use the digits 0-9. Thus, the octal number 10 is equivalent to the decimal number 8, octal 20 is the same as decimal 16, octal 100 is the same as decimal 64, and so on. No math is needed for this problem though; see the Approach/Algorithm section for some hints.

=end

def convert_to_base_8(n)
  n.to_s(8).to_i # replace these two method calls
end

# The correct type of argument must be used below
base8_proc = method(:convert_to_base_8).to_proc

# We'll need a Proc object to make this code work. Replace `a_proc`
# with the correct object
puts [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 33].map(&base8_proc) == [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]
