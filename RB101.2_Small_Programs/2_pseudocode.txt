For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

a method that returns the sum of two integers

    casual

    ask user for integer
    validate response (numerical? non-float?)
    ask user for integer
    validate response (numerical? non-float?)
    perform operation
    print value

    formal

    START
    GET input1
    IF isfloat or isstring
        error prompt, ask again
    GET input2
    IF isfloat or isstring
        error prompt, ask again
    response = input1 + input2
    PRINT response

a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

    casual

    create a blank string to hold final answer named response
    starting with the first, for each value in array, string-concatenate with response string
    once array is exhausted, print response

    formal

    # Assumed that proper array of string-typed objects are passed through method call
    SET empty response variable (string-typed)
    SET counter to 0
    WHILE counter < length of array
        response += nth_value
        counter += 1
    PRINT response

a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

    casual

    # Assume output expects 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc elements of input array
    create an empty array to hold final answer named response
    create an incrementer
    starting with the first, check modulus incrementer%2
        if 0, append to response
        if 1, continue
    once array is exhausted, print response

    formal

    SET empty response variable (array-typed)
    SET counter to 0
    WHILE counter < length of array
        IF even
            append value to response
        counter += 1
    PRINT response

No need to code here, just practice writing logic out in English.
